Artificial Intelligence Based Office Assisting Robot (CarryO Bot)
In this Project I have made an Artificial Intelligence Based Office Assisting Robot it uses Robotic operating system as firmware, google cartographer for localization, python programming, face recognition library, and speech output functionality as a software stack
In Hardawre I have used Cytron MDD10A Dual Channel Enhanced 10Amp motor driver, Planetary DC Geared Motor 170 RPM 27N-CM 12V IG32E-35K, custom designed Pcb, ultrasonic sensor, infrared sensor, 10000 mah lithium ion battery, Nvedia Jetson Nano 4gb, teensy 4.0 microcontroller, step-down module ,7 inch capacitive touch screen, YD Lidar x4 sensor, 150mm wheels, sheet metal body, aluminium extrusion for making body frame

Making The Body
You will find cad file in STEP format open it in any of the cad software and make the body as shown in the video 
Software Installation
1) make your jetson nano ready by installing its official websit
2) Install ros melodic into it
3) type below commands for installation of google cartographer and required modules Command:
4)make a catkin workspace and make a package named carryOBot copy the required ros files into the package
