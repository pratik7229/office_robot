# Artificial Intelligence Based Office Assisting Robot
Impressive! Your project, the "Artificial Intelligence Based Office Assisting Robot (CarryO Bot)," showcases a well-integrated fusion of hardware and software technologies. Leveraging the Robotic Operating System (ROS), Google Cartographer for localization, Python programming, face recognition, and speech output, your robot demonstrates a sophisticated software stack.

In terms of hardware, your choices are well-thought-out, including the Cytron MDD10A Dual Channel Enhanced 10Amp motor driver, Planetary DC Geared Motor, custom-designed PCB, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, a substantial 10000mAh lithium-ion battery, Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB, Teensy 4.0 microcontroller, step-down module, a 7-inch capacitive touch screen, YD Lidar x4 sensor, 150mm wheels, and a sturdy sheet metal and aluminum extrusion body frame.

This project not only highlights your technical skills in robotics and artificial intelligence but also your ability to integrate a diverse set of components to create a functional and advanced office-assisting robot. Well done!
